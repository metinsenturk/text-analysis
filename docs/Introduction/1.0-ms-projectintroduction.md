# News Analysis

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a machine learning research area that make the computers to understand and process human language. For a human, any given text would be meaningful, but for a computer, things might get more basic or complicated while decyphering the language. NLP aims to perform text analysis as humans understand the language, therefore, the it considers the hierarchical structure of language. Common examples of NLP applications will perfrom operations like text summarization, translation, named entity analysis, question anwsering, auto completion, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition and topic segmentation.

In this project, we are aiming to apply some of the NLP methods into news arcticles. We will spesifically focus on topic modeling and text summarization. We will apply these techniques into news dataset and try to categorize and summarize the news. As a final product, a command line application will be created and it will produce a summary with news category tags for any given text.

## Objectives

Our objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of topic modeling and text summarizion techniques in NLP by creating a working python application.

## Key Performance Indicators

A list of project evaluation indicators are provided in below.

- Complete documentation for every stage in NLP.

- Ability to apply and compare different machine learning techniques.

- Applying deep learning.

- Achieving above 85% accuracy on test dataset with valid model metrics.

- Dumping working models for both techniques.

- Having a project where a third person is able to install and setup the project in a timely fashion.

- Publishing the project in PyPI.
