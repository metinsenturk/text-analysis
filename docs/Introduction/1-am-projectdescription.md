#Defining project introduction

The creation fo this project is to go through the deep learning field and learn how to apply it in a NLP context. Knowing that deep learning models, compared to traditional machine largning, can perform really accurate, we are focused to understand more about it. But why applied to NLP? Because people communicate most everytHing in their own language: web search, advertisement, emails, social media, etc. That is why most of the problems we can find in internet is related to how people have relations with each other. So, to learn more about this behavior and know how to solve problems, we need to understand NLP.
