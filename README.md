# Text Analysis

This library is for us to explore natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We will be implementing some of the NLP models to the Hacker News Dataset. The goal is to expand our NLP knowledge and implement some of the standard NLP products like topic modeling, text summarization, etc. The objective is to have a working python application that will be able to apply selection NLP methods to any given text.

## Meetings

In order keep the project active, we will be meeting on a weekly basis in order discuss and determine tasks for past and future assignments.

| Date | Meeting # | Description |
